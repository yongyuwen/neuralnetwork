# neuralnetwork

Flexible TensorFlow Neural Network class that allows quick instantiation of a neural network model with various types of layers.
Layers supported: fully connected, convolutional, max-pooling, softmax.

Neural network class can be found in /src/network.py.  
Example on using the model to train and predict on the mnist dataset is found in /src/test.py
